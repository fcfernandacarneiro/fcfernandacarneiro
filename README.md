# Hello, I'm Fernanda👋

Welcome to my GitHub! A place where my love for learning, curiosity, and problem-solving coalesce.

🔍 Curiosity doesn’t only kill the cat in my world; it drives me to incessantly explore, learn, and devise solutions to problems.

🤝 I revel in assisting others and sharing knowledge, believing that collaborative growth is the best kind of growth.

🧠 Whether structuring problems or crafting solutions, I'm all in for the journey from curiosity to clarity.
